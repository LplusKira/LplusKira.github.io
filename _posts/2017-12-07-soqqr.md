# AWS
## now we spent $20.20 on AWS


# Vim
## what about auto reloading working dir's status in NERRDTREE?
## what about shell scripts' folding?
## always in vim -- employ [this method by fugitive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27340513/how-can-i-commit-files-currently-displayed-in-vim-with-fugitive?answertab=votes#tab-top) to achieve commiting in vim 



# OS
## How to check the repos of yum?
- [commands](https://access.redhat.com/discussions/750393)
```
  yum repolist
```
- sample results
```

## what happened when I first use __rpm -Uvh ../nginx/*.rpm__ to install nginx on centos7 on EC2:
```
  error: Failed dependencies:
    openssl is needed by ...
    ...
```
- and since I don't think it would be necessary to know what really happens for yum managing those dependencies under different OS versions, I guess it'd be better we just google the rpm files and download 'em now lol
- actually I found [this page](https://centos.pkgs.org) helpful
## urls I needed for nginx's rpm dependencies
- https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/openssl-1.0.2k-8.el7.x86_64.rpm.html
- http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/gd-2.0.35-26.el7.x86_64.rpm
- oh ... damn it -- too many
- OK -- finally I tried not to install nginx offline (to be specific, from rpm files), here's the new [resource](https://www.liberiangeek.net/2014/07/enable-nginxs-repository-install-nginx-centos-7/) 
- And the previous method worked out. So now I have a __dummy__ nginx on my EC2 
## lets review how to find some files:
```
  find /some/dir -name "yourExactFileName"
```


# Git
## Damn it ... I accidentally delete my Gitlab dirs ...
## What if I'd like to have different remotes? Say I have a local repository and a cloud one (perhaps I just setup on AWS), which may not be on Gitlab since I don't want to go public with something credential and I don't want to pay some extra fee for private repositories (but maybe Bitbucket could be a choice?)
- then, to my current knowledge, it would be best to revisit what a remote is and what does __git push origin master__ exactly do?
