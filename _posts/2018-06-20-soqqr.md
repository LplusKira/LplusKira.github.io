# Sentence completion Flow
1. skim & recognize type
2. find keyword (special rules, then clues, then transitional words)
3. rm wrongheaded options
4. choose (if choose between 2 sets; check meaning) OR guess the longer ones OR guess the one with "only" OR guess the one u don't recognize

# Sentence completion Type
## And:
- likewise
- increasingly
- not only but
- as well as
- and , ; "--"
- __compare__

## But:
- __given__
- nevertheless, although, notwithstanding, even though
- despite, in spite of
- so many A __this|one__ B
- on the other hand
- __yet (conj)__, __still__, instead
- however, not, never
- __A rather than B__
- __balance A with B__
- __initially A eventually B__
- __no surprise__, __surprising__
- __seemingly__, __seem__
- contrast
- paradoxical, ironically
- far from
- __in fact__, __in reallity__
- __as likely__ A __as__ B

## Because: (A => B)
- since, because (since: "自從" <=> S has + pp, since)
- __so|such A that B__
- __just as A so B__
- A __;__ as a result|consequence, B
- A __;__ consequentially|accordingly|therefore, B
- A __;__ because of this (A), B
- A __;__ hence|thus, B
- A be the reason for B
- A be responsible for B
- A lead|contribute to B
- A result in B
- A cause B
- A be the cause of B
- A __bring about__ B
- B result|arise|follow|stem __from__ A
- B be due to A
- B be the result of A
- B be a consequence of A
- B be attributed|attributable to A 
- (Adv) Adj A, B (<=> "Because A adj (adv), B")
- (Adj) N A, B (<=> "Because A (adj) N, B")
- A so that B

## Modifiers:
- adj, adv, participles

# Sentence completion Special rules
- choose directly from __undermine__, __undercut__, __at odds__
- __Never__ have I ever chosen __fortuitous__, __"have no bearing on"__, __irrelevant__ from options
- clues searching rule: v, then adj|adv, then n
- exceptions for v:
```
  ... focus on obj ...  // then of course the clue's obj

  ... conclude someShit ...  // then of course the clue's obj

  for cognitive verbs, clue's on obj
    S + think|know|recognize|guess|suppose|pressume + obj

  for possession verbs, clue's on obj
    S + have|receive|get|hold|obtain|belong to|possess + obj

  view|regard A as B
  A be viewed as B
    clue's OC|SC
      John is viewed as a fool (SC)
      I view John as a cluster of shit (OC)

  for linking verbs, clue's on SC
    S + beV|prove|seem|appear|get|become + SC(adj|n)
```
- "adj + n"|"n + adj phrase"|"n + adj clause" => clue's adj
```
  Damn, u r soooo "good"
```
- __as (prep) + n|adj__, clue's on n|adj
- __only A__, clue's on A
- __wary of__ + negative stuff

# Verbal reasoning Flow
- Determine type
- If cant determine thru type, eliminate choices that __discuss out of range (g 同 ya 講: out-of-scope discussion)__ OR __lack generousity__ (e.g. highest/lowest)

## Weaken: (expect to choose from the choice that can either) 
### Key words: undermine, 
1. Prove the premise wont exist
2. Prove there's other dominant factor to support the result
3. (Given stats => result) Prove __selection bias__ OR __insufficient samples__ OR __comparison bias__

## Assumption:
### Key words: depend on, assumption, relies, given
- Find the __necessary & sufficient cond__
- Test the choice by checking "negate premise => negate result" is true

## Support:
### Key words: indicate, (most) strengthen
- Find __the most independent__ factor to support the result

## Conclusion:
### Key words: "exactly a hole", implies
- Likely, a hole for you to fill up
- You need to conclude some argument

## Explain/evaluation:
- Trivial ones

# Reading Flow:
- Define each problem's type -- solve those belonging to Details last
- Solve through the procedure defined by each problem's type
- Choose the sentence without __primarily, only, basically__ if hesitant

# Reading Type
## Main idea:
### Key words: __(primarily) concerned with__, main point
- Check each paragraph's main point -- read those related ones' first 2 sentences
- If there's still dubious options left -- sorry pup, keep reading each paragraph's remaining sentences then

## Attitude/Difference:
### Key words: __suggest__, __address (issue)__, most supported (statements), __differ__
- Find __contrastive__ clues, including
- REPLACING: alternatively, again, rather, but then, on the other hand
- ANTITHETIC: but, conversely, instead, then, on the contrary, by contrast
- CONCESSION: aaaaaanyway, anyhow, however, nevertheless, nonetheless, notwithstanding, still, (al)though, yet, for all that (in spite of something just mentioned), in spite of, 
- Push those enclosing sentences with the clues to TOREAD list
- Push the proceding sentences with __this, that__ to TOREAD list
- Read, sequentially, sentences in the TOREAD list

## Purpose:
### Key words: __mention__, in order to, function of, describe (description)
- Read, only, both the sentence containing the target (key words) and the previous sentence of it
- If that doesn't determine all choices, read the whole paragraph

## Details:
### Key words: be inferred
- From the problem itself, search for possible search clues
- Search those paragraphs containing the search clues and READ them all

# Reading Cheat Sheet
- __must have Vp__ => __Vp is deemed as Truth__
- (Though) It's true that ... blabla => __It's true__ stands for concession
- In the opening of a passage, "S1 Rather/But/However S2" implies that S2 is the main topic
- The sentence following the question is NOT always the answer (e.g. "? __Perhaps__, it __could__ be blabla ... But, it's actually ..." => "But, it's actually ..." should be the answer)

# Reading Misc
## Difference of main points & supporting details:
- Main point conveys: __thesis OR topic (e.g. problem, phenomenon, fact)__
- Supporting point has: evidence, sol, argument
## Mind of the author, highly positive:
- distinctively (the sound is distinctively his)
- archaeological record
## Mind of the author, highly negative:
- On its face (On its face, this question seems absurd)
- at odds with
- minor, small (with a minor master)
