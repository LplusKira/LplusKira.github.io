# AWS:
## let me in:
- login -> click on __Security Groups__ on the __NETWORK & SECURITY__ left-hand tab -> edit/add the __Inbound__ rule
- [this is gonna help](http://www.techinfected.net/2016/09/run-pyton-simplehttpserver-on-amazon-aws-ec2.html)

# OS:
## what does __traceroute__ do
- trace the route through which a packet would be sent from some current machine to another host
- flow:
1. traceroute each time sends three packets with the same number of ttl (and the number is increased by one in the next time) 
2. Note that ttl may be viewed as 'energy points' -- each encountered gateway will reduce/cost it by one.
3. Each line (begins from '1.') from the output of traceroute indicates three parts:
- the number of ttl of this run
- the gateway/host's ip
- the three separate empirical rtt the corresponding packets take
4. * may be thought as 'time out' to this point
```bash
    man traceroute # for more info
```
## how/why to change ur (default) dns server
