# AWS:
## Currently we spent $77 on AWS

# Node.js:
## I got parseInt err in map like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14528397/strange-behavior-for-map-parseint), wt heck?!
- So the basic idea is that I ommit/ignore the 2nd val passed by __map__ is index and that the 2nd argument of __parseInt__ is radix -- OMG
- [Check the array's element's been assigned before __map__](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
## [Do we stick to non-native Promise libraries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34960886/are-there-still-reasons-to-use-promise-libraries-like-q-or-bluebird-now-that-we)?
## [Is it still suitable to declare Promise globally when requiring bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues/1026) ?

# Python:
## Who? ipython vs bpython? 
- Seems to me I should get ipython for [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4233430) post
- And some may recommend Jupyter, which should be some IDE I guess
- But currently I'd say that ipython pretty meet my need
## Append in numpy?
- [This]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtejJ3RCddE&t=8570') is why you CANT/shouldnt do that

# Vim:
## Change log?
- [Piece of scallion cake](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/List_changes_to_the_current_file)
- Just do __:changes__
- Or you may wanna jump to previous __check point__ by using __:g;__ (and __:g,__ to the next)
## Check any file containing some str after __grep__
- Just do __:cw__ in Vim editor
## Javascript Promise folding ??
