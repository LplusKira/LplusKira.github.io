# Chrome:
## [better search](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/15/how-to-use-search-like-a-pro-10-tips-and-tricks-for-google-and-beyond) with ease (may not be restricted to Google's search engine ... and I just kind of lazy to establish another tag):
- __Exactly__ say you want "Mraz Json" -- search exactly with quotes __"Mraz Json"__ (may be compared with "Jason Mraz")
- __Exclude__ some phrases in searching Jason Mraz -- search Jason Mraz with __-"some phrase"__ (e.g. Jason Mraz -"i'm yours")
- __I want one of__ some names to be searched -- search __Jason Mraz OR Bruno Mars OR Maroon 5__ 
- __Im not sure__ whether this category is right -- search __qq ~Taiwan__ (without ~Taiwan, nobody knows you are referring to qq in Taiwanese slang)
- __I only want to search in__ some site -- search __site:someSite urQuery__ (e.g. site:facebook.com resume)
- __Is the spelling__ right for Json Mrez to mean Json Mrroz or ... -- search __Jason Mr*__ 
- __Where would you go__? title? body? url? review? -- search __"JSON Mraz":intitle "JSON Mraz":intext "JSON Mraz":inurl "JSON Mraz":review__ 
- __Related sites, please__? -- search __related:github.com__
- despite of the fact that nearly 90% of tech problems can be kinda resolved in SO ...
