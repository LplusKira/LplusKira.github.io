# Murmur:
- I should havd better layout for my github.io (the current one seems to be pretty clumsy ...)
- would like to try the new stable version of ELK and resolve some old issues like kibana's timeout issue
- should I try TopResume ? cauz that amounts to 220 USD ... and will that really work out for me ??
- how to get a domain name?
