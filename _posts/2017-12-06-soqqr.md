# AWS

# Tmux
## why do I need to source ~/.bashrc everytime starting up another tmux session/window/pane?
- no you don't have to
- according to [the answer from Chris Page](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12993/why-doesnt-bashrc-run-automatically?answertab=votes#tab-top), only the login startup script (which is ??) is run
- we need to add __source ~/.bashrc__ to ~/.bash_profile (create such file if it doesn't exist)
- you may need __tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf__ to reload the tmux config -- works like a charm for me now
