# Entrepreneurship:
## what about a __shopping record__ app?
### idea
- as a single housewife/husband or a loser, dont u really want to record any penny u spent
- if the shop cant offer a reciept, what about a short conversation with a built-in sound-recognition module
- anyway, its goal is to record your shopping records (behaviour) and maybe provide u with a __more economic__ way in purchasing stuff
