# AWS
## Currently we spent $37.7 on AWS

# ELK
## I'm building ELK on AWS now 4 showcase usage, and I'm pretty thankful for this [repo](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk) -- though the version of elasticsearch, logstash, and kibana are far way from those versions I recognized

# Murmur
- Take care of kafka-zk setup in containerization and docker-compose file
