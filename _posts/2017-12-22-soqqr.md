# AWS:
## Currently we spent $63.81 on AWS

# Node.js:
## Singly Linked List? 
- [That](https://thatjsdude.com/interview/linkedList.html#singlyLinkedList)'s awesome!
- __Slice is O(N) where N is end - start__ -- oh that's incredible (?!)
- History of ["use strict"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it?answertab=votes#tab-top) -- to my very basic understanding, it basically says that, by puting these strings intor some code block, it can somehow prevents some terrifying actions

# Git:
## [Pretty log of commits in tree](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1064361/unable-to-show-a-git-tree-in-terminal?answertab=votes#tab-top)
- So far, __git log --all --oneline --graph__ works like a charm for me
- --all reveal all commits (this may not contain the commits on other branches according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4786972/list-of-all-git-commits))
- --oneline abbreviates the content of each commit (hash and commit comment only)
- --graph show the commit history in a pretty tree layout
