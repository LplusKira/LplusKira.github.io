# AWS
## if you are curious why the stopped instance has been mirrored to another instance (or, auto scaled), it's probably the instance is run under some autoscaling policy enabling it to do so
- check the running instance's autoscaling policy first
- then go to the [page](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home "should be redirected to the right server region, in my case, '?region=us-west-2#AutoScalingGroups:' is appended"), which lists your autoscaling policies 
- click the checkbox of the scaling policy (say its name is scale1)
- click __Details__ pane and click __Edit__ button
- in __Suspended Processes__, leave it only with __Terminate__ -- for further information, you should check [the life cycle of ec2 instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html "awesome illustration")
- don't forget to click __save__
- go suspending the instance(s) again
- and yes, the stopped instance can go back to __Start__ status
## the need for stopping instances (and keep 'em) may be due to experiments and our __tight budgets__ ...
## downsides:
- the instance's public IP changes under my experiment
- in [the lifecycle illustration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html), it seems like we can only suspend __Terminate__ if the underlying AMI is __EBS-backed__ -- might be some problem??
