# AWS:
## Currently we spent $80 on AWS

# Node.js:
## Bluebird revisit:
- If you pass a promise object to the resolve function, __the created promise will follow the state of that promise__.
```
  const Promise = require('bluebird');
  const aPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // vvv if you wanna resolve
    // resolve('hello');
    reject('world');
  });
  const bPromise = Promise.resolve(aPromise).catch(function(err){
    console.log('So its OOOOO ' + err + ' again?');
  });
  
  // Then bPromise should inherit aPromise's state (i.e. rejected)
  // 'So its OOOOO world again?' should be printed
```
- Actually, we may make bPromise handle aPromise's rejection in then like
```
  const bPromise = Promise.resolve(aPromise).then(function(resV){
    console.log('This cant happen', resV);
  }, function(rejV){ 
    console.log('Since its ' + rejV + ' ,you got rejected');
  }).catch(function(err){
    console.log('For any unexpected err lile', err);
  });

  // Should print 'Since its world ,you got rejected'
```
- [Filtered catch](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/catch.html#filtered-catch) looks more reliable ...
- Perhaps the previous one's rejection handling function in then is a long-term of __catch(function(someErr){ .. })__? We got supported [here](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/catch.html#catch-all)
- [This](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33260670) is how you chaining Promises' val in if else branch
## If you are wondering why __npm install -g SOMEPACKAGE__ doesnt work on OSX, [this](export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules) might work
## [What is V8 and how does it work?](http://thibaultlaurens.github.io/javascript/2013/04/29/how-the-v8-engine-works/)
- Javascript is a [Prototype-inheritance lang](https://stackoverflow.com/a/186279)
- The most intiguing thing is what happens once the underlying instance has only, say 518 MB, to run javascript code in __Node.js__ -- GC by V8 engine just couldn't help but rest!
## Go back to check [__event loop__](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/)
## Why do __let__ and __var__ behave differently? [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31285911/why-let-and-var-bindings-behave-differently-using-settimeout-function) is exactly what has confused me for a while ...
