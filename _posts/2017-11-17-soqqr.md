# Murmur:
## it's possible to work in the US without graduating over there -- you basically need somebody who recognizes your ability (think about how many Indians work there without US diploma)
## a number of examples reveal that even a graduated American (from somewhere?) cant recieve a nice job offer and that an American civilian may still found it hard in landing a job
## english communication skill is VERY important in landing a job in the US
## why would a recruiter hire me rather than the equally-like American with profilient eng, American diploma (what if from standford, mit, cmu ... ), and no need to waste the h1b money on me?
## possibility to pay a visit and land a job there?
## is the best well-paid and comfortabel place in SWE on this planet American ?
## stock price I'd like to pay my long-term attention on: microsoft, alibaba, facebook, samsung, alphabet, amazon
