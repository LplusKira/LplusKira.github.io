# JavaScript:
- D3

# Python:
## [For connecting basic ML ideas to scikit-learn implementation](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-machine-learning-algorithms-you-need-to-know-77fb0055fe0)
## So [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2998544/9326078) is 'Python': I've misinterpreted Python as CPython's interpretation

# Entreperneur:
- Automatic search context by viewing behaviour? recommend background knowledge?
- stash current job list in chrome ext (since most in chrome tabs?)
- 'googling' of pdf words? useful when reading docs
- 'Behaviour'-based spent time estimator?

# Chrome:
- __command + option + u__ to view page source in Mac
- [Imitate different network connection speeds](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/network-conditions)

# ML:
- Constraint-satisfaction task
- Constraint-satisfaction searches
- Strong constraints (problem domains s.a. games or puzzles)
- Weak constraints (problem domains s.a. finding the most plaussible interpretation of an image) -- not 'all-or-none' criteria
- Perceptual interpretation task
- Hopfield (weight in representing the correlation of a pair of hypotheses, other things equal), for [quick catch-up](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rosen/161/notes/hopfield.html)
- Hopfield -- for [implemented library n some other insights](http://neupy.com/2015/09/20/discrete_hopfield_network.html#synchronous)
- Hopfield Network -- you man still __need__ to check the original publication __Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computationalabilities__ by __J. J. Hopfield__ in 1982
- Emergent collective computational abilities
- [Emergent algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_algorithm) -- think about 'fuzzily' match a sentence to some meaning; think about 'fuzzily' match an environment to some finite-dim state
- Delocalized content-addressable memory
A general content-addressable memory can retrieve 'What a good damn' by sufficient partial info / words such as 'What damn'; for more advanced ones, it may handle 'madamn' like 'damn'
- Extensive asynchronous parallel processing
- Ising model

# Vim:
- [Vim plugins for Web Development](https://gosukiwi.svbtle.com/vim-configuration-for-web-development#vim-plugins-for-web-development_1)
- html auto-completion
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone http://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim.git
" (Add to vimrc) Plugin 'mattn/emmet-vim'
```
```
ctrl-y-,
```
- [Open 'em all in tabs](https://superuser.com/a/171774)
```
vim f1 f2
:tab all
```
To iterate the opened tabs
```
:tabnext
```
In each tab, you can definitely split new windows
- [Open 'em all in splited windows](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4598563/9326078)
I believe that wildcard and some regular expressions should be OK
```
args f1 f2 f3 | all
```

# Architecture:
- Should IO/Web dominate the highest level of architecture OR should what the product does dominate?
- BCE (boundary controller/interactor entity) model
- And then .com bubbled (BCE was forgotten ...); engineers then, sooner or later, forgot BCE
- One of the highest goal: you should be able to test all the business rules without a web server running -- more like unit tests
- MVC (not even an architecture) was introduced in the 70s
```
     View
      ^  ^
     /    \
   Model (accepte View's register & update info to View) with
   BO1 (bussiness object), BO2
   ^ ^-- --------------------^
  / /  /
Controller (accept inputs, like clicks, push corresponding cmds to Model)
```
- Why would MVC be popular? By Bob, MVC was good; so they used it?!
- Why could MVC be horrible? The complex nested dependencies ... Check [this](https://youtu.be/Nsjsiz2A9mg?t=2120)
- How about MVP to remove the not-welldefined boundaries? MVP?
```
  I KNOW WEB            WTF IS WEB? EDIBLE?
                  ||
  Presenter -------> Boundary <- Interactor -> Entities
    |     \       ||                |
    v      \      ||                v
  View data \-----------------> Response
    ^             ||
    |             ||
  View (module)
```
- Pros: we can test Presenter, Interactor, Entities without Web; componets on the LHS always have only inward arrows to the RHS -- they behave as plugins!
- Bob: Plug it in!
- Source code control systems, such as Git, actually stores transactions (commits) rather than states
- Database is a detail!
- For any details, we'd like to treat 'em like plugins!
- Bob: [A good architecture is one that allows you to defer decisions (decisions about UI/DB/Frameworks; an awesome architect maximize the number of decisions that could be made later](https://youtu.be/Nsjsiz2A9mg?t=3376)


# Tests:
- Challenge: automatic unit/integration/acceptance tests?
- Integration tests: 'across-entities' tests, e.g. some function + test DB
- Acceptance tests: app/product-level tests; perhaps [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) for web app?
- A decent comment, and I quote here, "If you feel it’s not easy to write a unit test, chances are it’s not a unit test at all."
- TDD: test before implemtation
- BDD: behaviour over implemnetation


# Murmur:
- [Uncle Bob, Robert C Martin's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsjsiz2A9mg) on __Clean Architecture & Design__
- Hyper-threading?
- Dreamweaver for quick demo (like ppt)?
- An organization in charging of all web technologies: [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)
- PS?

# Songs:
- [Fullmetal Alchmist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcoFyWE-3zg)
