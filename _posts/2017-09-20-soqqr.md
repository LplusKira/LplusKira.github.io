# OSX:
## open QuickTime recording once I work
- OK, at least we embark on this task with cmd line ...
- special thanks to [this answere](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17600520 "this answere"), [this post](https://discussions.apple.com/message/668654#message668654 "this post"), and [this](http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?pid=96785#p96785 "simple ops on dates")

# Murmur:
## [share screen btw MBP & android](https://www.splashtop.com/wiredxdisplay)
```
    man this work like a charm to me ... now bro we may use this to hook up with some hood/good girls
    
    side effect: WiredXDisplay takes about 50% cpu on MBP with only a chrome window with 'Uptown Funk it' played on it and a iterm2 window doing nothing
    
    overall, it deserves $7 for me to own this -- it's awesome
```

## just found out how to use [urban lib](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php? "useful for some cool phrases")
- e.g. add __?term=hook+up__ to [urban lib](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?) will give u the definition of __hook up__
