## [article about chatbots](https://www.developereconomics.com/nlp-wit-luis-api-ai) and some comments:
- it's about the rise of delievering DIY NLP system to end users -- and [rasa](https://rasa.breezy.hr/) is hiring backend/ML engineer 
- [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/), [luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai/home), [api.ai](https://api.ai/) -- 3rd party NLP libriaries
- [databot](http://www.databot-app.com/) -- some interesing app that, under my use case, can at least tell me a joke and brief me about Json Mraz 
- [admithub](https://www.admithub.com/) -- seems to be a bot that may customize to answere question like "Am I permitted to own a cat in my dorm room?" for an undergrad
