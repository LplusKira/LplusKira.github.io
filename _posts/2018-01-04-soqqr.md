# Node.js:
## Unfortunately, Node.js doesn't support for fascinating __import__ and __export__ in __ES6__ currently from [this](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_ecmascript_modules) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39436580)
## [AWESOME article](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) -- appreciate the words: "I am not content, nor should you be, at stopping once something just works, and not really knowing why." from [this](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/preface.md)
## Concepts review (in __JavaScript__, but it's more suitable to create 'em here):
- Statement vs Expression
- Variable vs Value
- Expression statement vs Call expression statement
- Intepreter vs Compiler ([the stunning part](It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. But that's not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.))
- Primitive values
- Loose equal vs Strict equal
- Comments (One of rule of thumbs: "Comments should explain why, not what.")
- Static typing (type enforcement) vs Weak typing
- Scope (Lexical scope) -- many thanks to [this](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch1.md#errors) post
```
  // Oops, we dont have 'use strict' here ...
  function foo() {
    qoo();
    function qoo() {
      b = 123;
    }
  }
  
  function zoo() {
    coo();
    function coo() {
      console.log(b);
    }
  }
  
  foo(); // VS zoo() then foo()
  zoo();
```
```
  // Consider following code from https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch2.md#eval
  // Well, actually, if not mentioned, code blocks in the following come from You-Dont-Know-JS
  function foo(str, a) {
    eval(str); // We cheat that we author some code like 'var b = 3;' here
    console.log(a, b, gg);  // Just a small modification here
  }
  
  var b = 2;
  var gg = 12;
  
  foo("var b = 3; var gg = 123;", 1); // 1 3 123
```
```
  // This is soqq function thats gonna recursively add 1 till 10
  var a = 1;
  (function soqq() {
    if (a < 10 ) {
      a += 1;
      soqq();
    } else {
      console.log(a);
    }
  })();
  soqq();  // Should throw Ref err -- soqq is not defined in this (this case, global) scope
```
```
  // Compare the following err stack of each ill-coded codes (A, B, C)
  // A
  (function soqq() {
    if (a < 10 ) {
      a += 1;
      soqq();
    } else {
      console.log(a);
    }
  })();

  // B
  setTimeout( function(){
      console.log(a, "I waited 1 second!");
  }, 1000 );

  // C
  setTimeout( function waitAMinQuestionMark(){
      console.log(a, "I waited 1 second!");
  }, 1000 );
```
```
  var a = 2;
  var imSoGlobal = {
    a: a,
  };
  (function IIFE(global){
    var a = 3;
    console.log(a); // 3
    console.log(global.a); // 2
  })(imSoGlobal);
  
  console.log(a); // 2
```
- Built-in type-methods
- Lexicolgraphical order
- Auto-global variable declaration
```
  foo();  // This 'foo' works cauz of 'hoisting' effect
  function foo() {
    bar();
    function bar() {
      // VS 'use strict'
      a = 1;  // VS var/let/const a = 1
    }
  }
  console.log('Im sorry that you got an a like:', a);  // This a is accessible cauz 'auto-global'
```
- Block scoped (with, try/catch, let, const)
- Immediately Invoked Functions Expressions (IIFEs)
- Closure VS Class
```
  function biggerThan(x) {
    function isBiggerThan(y) {
        return y > x;
    }

    return isBiggerThan;
  }
  const isBiggerThan10 = biggerThan(10);
  console.log(isBiggerThan10(9));  // Should be false
```
- __arguments__
- __this__ is (quoted from [the page](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch1.md#whats-this)) "When a function is invoked, an activation record, otherwise known as an execution context, is created. This record contains information about where the function was called from (the call-stack), how the function was invoked, what parameters were passed, etc. One of the properties of this record is the __this__ reference which will be used for the duration of that function's execution. ... __this__ is actually a binding that is made when a function is invoked, and what it references is determined entirely by the call-site where the function is called."
- Call-site
```
  // Whats this?
  function foo() {
    console.log( this.a );
  }
  
  var obj2 = {
    a: 42,
    foo: foo
  };
  
  var obj1 = {
    a: 2,
    obj2: obj2
  };
  
  obj1.obj2.foo(); // 42
```
```
  // OK ... Which is T? "bar references to obj referencing to foo" OR "bar references to foo, thats it"
  function foo() {
    console.log( this.a );
  }
  
  var obj = {
    a: 2,
    foo: foo
  };
  
  var bar = obj.foo; // function reference/alias!
  
  var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object
  
  bar(); // "oops, global"
```
```
  // We simply wanna build a helper (which is 'bind' here) that can:
  // - bind a targeting fn with another designated obj
  // And also note this: 'Since hard binding is such a common pattern, it's provided with a built-in utility as of ES5: Function.prototype.bind' -- quoted from https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md#hard-binding
  function foo(something) {
    console.log( this.a, something );
    return this.a + something;
  }
  
  // simple `bind` helper
  function bind(fn, obj) {
    return function() {
      return fn.apply( obj, arguments );
    };
  }
  
  var obj = {
    a: 2
  };
  
  var bar = bind( foo, obj );
  
  var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
  console.log( b ); // 5
```
- Implicit Binding VS Explicit Binding VS 'New' Binding (And ordery?)
- __prototype__
```
  const foo = {
    a: 42,
  };
  
  // create `bar` and (prototype-)link it to `foo`
  var bar = Object.create(foo);
  console.log('Here "bar" right after prototype-linking', bar);
  var barbara = foo;
  bar.b = 'hello world';  // VS barbara.b = 'hello world'
  
  console.log('Here "bar" right after assigning "b" property', bar);
  console.log('Here "barbara"', barbara, 'should be the same as "foo"', foo);
  console.log('This is bar, I can fall back to foo.a, which is (processing ...) bar.a: ', bar.a);
  
  bar.a = 123;
  console.log('This is foo after assignment of a in bar', foo);
  console.log('This is bar after assignment of a in me', bar);  // A feeling of inheritance
```
```
  foo();
  function foo() {
    console.log( a ); // undefined
  
    var a = 2;  // VS a = 2; Do you see the difference? Hint: Compiler + Declaration Hoisting + RHS
  }
```
```
  foo(); // TypeError ------\
  bar(); // ReferenceError -/ You see the difference? Wt if these two lines are put after function expression 'var foo = ...' block?
  
  var foo = function bar() {
      // ...
  };
```
```
  // Who's first hoisted? Who's been ignored?
  // Read (https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch4.md#functions-first) if confused
  foo(); // 1

  var foo;
  
  function foo() {
    console.log( 1 );
  }
  
  foo = function() {
    console.log( 2 );
  };
```
```
  // Expectation of log?
  console.log('top', i);
  var i = 0;
  console.log('after assignment', i);
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log('looping --', i);
    setTimeout(() => {  // Es-lint complains that, and I quote: Don't make functions within a loop
      console.log('soTimeout', i);
    }, 0);
  }
  i = 100;
  console.log('bot', i);
```
```
  // VS for (let i = 0; ...) <-- is 'i' gonna be declared for each iteration?
  // In case you missed this: https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md#let-loops for (var i=1; i<=5; i++) { let j = i; // yay, block-scope for closure!  setTimeout( function timer(){ console.log( j );
    }, j*1000 );
  }
```
- Closure
```
  // The reason why the following will work -- closure
  var qq = 1000;  // This qq shouldn't be used in the following code due to the rule of lexical-scope searching rule
  function foo() {
    var qq = 0;
    function addBy1() {
      qq += 1;
    }
    function minusBy1() {
      qq -= 1;
    }
    function qqlog() {
      console.log('yDoUcallMe -- from qq', qq);
    }
  
    return {  // vvv Has the lexical scope closure over inner scope's of foo
      addBy1: addBy1,
      minusBy1: minusBy1,
      qqlog: qqlog,
    };
  }
  
  var baibaodai = foo();  // GC of foo never happens here
  baibaodai.addBy1();
  baibaodai.addBy1();
  baibaodai.qqlog();
  baibaodai.minusBy1();
  baibaodai.qqlog();  // GC of foo never happens before here, too
```
- Lexical Scope (JavaScript) VS Dynamic Scope (Bash scripting)
- Non-javascript
- Principle of Least Privilege (Least Exposure)
- Refactoring
- (Browser's built-in) Debugger
- Construction Calls of Functions VS Constructor Functions (Which one truly exists in JavaScript? Herher ...)
## __Takeaways__ -- say when you're __tracing codes__ and get pretty confused with some identifier's val, you should consider:
- Lexical scope that's defined in code-editing phase, which should be 
- Q0: Is the (global) scope covered by __'use strict'__?
- Yes -- __No need__ to consider __auto-global-declaration__ from LHS look-up, 
- Q1: Is there any function calls, such as __eval__ and __with__(highly __deprecated__), that could invoke dynamic code generations (thus change lexical scope at runtime)?
- Consider __hoisting__, Q0, and Q1, where was the identifier born?
- Is the current function __function expression__ or __function declaration__?
- Is there any weird repetitive declaration of the current token name?
- Yes -- remember that its more natural that the compiler take the __latest declaration of function__ over whatever previous function declaration over whatever variable declaration
- Is there any function calls in __closure__ status that you are not aware of?
## __Takeaways__ -- say when you're __adding new features__ to the current project:
- How many APIs should be open? Consider minimum privilledge exposure ...
- Should the current function involked multiple times?
- No -- then try IIFE (be able to not even pollute its enclosing scope) with function name assigned (useful in debugging)
- Make __explicit blocks__ (parentheses) and consider the code's __refactory capability__
## __Takeaways__ -- other rules you'd be aware of:
- Repetitive declarations through __var__'s gonna be ommitted by compiler, whereas __let__ declaration after var on the same token name will lead to (only tested on Nodejs) SyntaxError -- that is, not even pass the compiler.
- (Common) Error sequence: SyntaxError (happens when your code did something illegal in the sense of syntax, e.g. __qq a = 1__; the corresponding result is that your code doesnt even pass compiler) -> ReferenceError (happens when engines try to do a RHS look-up indicated by the corresponding machine code but there's no targeting identifier declared in any scope through lexical scope searching rule) -> TypeError (happens when the engine wants to use some property that doesnt belong to current identifier)
- Global variables (i.e. identifiers declared at global scope) are exactly the properties of the global object __window__
- The reason why we reject __with__ and __eval__ is thak they __make lower readibility of codes__ and __refuse the code optimization in compiler phase__
- The lexical scope of an identifier (variable or function) __only__ maters in __where__ its been declared.
- Lexical Scope can be divided into __function scope__ (scope created by function) and __block scope__ (__let__ some identifier stick to current block; __catch__ constraint the error; we dont care about __with__, right?)
- Least exposure of your APIs -- collisions avoidance && module management
- Named functions benefit in debugging && recursion calls
- Explicit brackets/parentheses for blocking imroves __refactory capability__ and __gc__
- View __let__'s usage in for loop as __repetitive__ assignment to the identifier created by let -- thus __multiple individual scopes__ is created by __each iteration__
- __Closure__ is a status/ability that a function that will follow the __(enclosing) lexical scope__ when it's declared (even if it's executed outside of that scope).
