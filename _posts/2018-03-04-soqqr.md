# Python:
## Distutils (packaging framework since Python3)
- [Official guide](http://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopTutorial#Submitting_Packages_to_the_Package_Index)
- build tool for maintainer
- installation tool for end users
- package metadata for search engines
- integrates with PyPI (Python Package Index)
## __setup.py__ should be as standard (boring) as possible
## [Put Codes to PyPI: tutorial](http://www.diveintopython3.net/packaging.html)
- Create private an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form)
- And follow the tutorial
- Perhaps [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45209514/9326078) would be helpful resolving distutils repo url migration problem
- But Errors like "HTTPError: 400 Client Error: Invalid file extension" would follow by using __twine upload dist/*__ -- we have to say goodbeye to dist/SOMENAME.exe which is for Windows' user's graphical user-friendly installation
- Check https://pypi.org/project/YOURAWESOMEPROJECT/

# JavaScript:
## [Chrome extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index)
- [An awesome start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew9ut7ixIlI)
- [A probably decent pause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJtjp-Vtwjs)
- manifest.json
- Content Script
- Background Script
- Messaging from Background Script to Content Script? __messaging__
- pop-up
## Quick debugging in JS codes with [Chrome's dev tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/)

# Vim:
## [ignore E501 in flake8](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic/issues/204)
- __let g:syntastic_python_flake8_args='--ignore=E501'__
## Go last write 
- __:earlier 1f__

# ML:
## An [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/artificial-intelligence-and-bad-data-fbf2564c541a) full of insights and pratical experience
- Quote -- "It is important to know when error is caused by bad things in the data rather than caused by improperly fitting to the data"
## Damn son! [This](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats) is so awesome!

# Murmur:
## OK, thers's a thing called [Software release lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle)
## You dont know when you simply dont -- you're not gonna aware of yourself as an paramecium whenever you are.
