# Node.js:
## npm ERR! fatal: Unable to find remote helper for 'git+http'
```
  npm install -g npm
```
If this problem emerges and you are using __local git repository__ in the attribute of dependency of pacakage.json, then it's quite possible that the npm needs to be upgraded. Just another remind -- this should be implemented in all other dockernized projects. (But still, I'm still wondering if this is possible to be some 'issue' created by gitlab's updation since this issue doesn't happen before ... But now I use the newer version of gitlab.) 

This version works.
```
lpluskira$ npm --version
5.5.1
```

## npm ERR! remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied
Also, for simplicity in development, it would be better to grant the visibility to arbitrary users. (That is, for those who want to clone some specific project, they'll need to input the user name and the corresponding password -- if the project is public, there's no need for this from my experiment)
