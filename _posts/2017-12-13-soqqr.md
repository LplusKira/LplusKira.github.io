## Currently we spent $40 on AWS

## If you are gonna run gitlab locally through, say [this](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab) awesome project, and with the help of CI through [this](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/docker.html) and [this](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html) (to be exact, you want to run CI by containerized gitlab CI runner -- thus you should choose/type __docker__ when [the interactive gitlab runner shell](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html) asks you to enter your preferred Runner executor), u'll need to:
- Set up the gitlab through docker-compose
- Run the gitlab runner by the aforementioned guide
- Remember to modify __- GITLAB_HOST=localhost__ to __- GITLAB_HOST=yourAwesomeGitlabDomain__ 

# Node.js:
## So today we r gonna [add eslint to Vim](https://medium.com/@hpux/vim-and-eslint-16fa08cc580f) -- currently I setup __Airbnb__ in my stlye (after all, my need basically rises from linting Node.js codes)

- So it seems to me that we may follow [this post](https://medium.com/@hpux/vim-and-eslint-16fa08cc580f)
- Since I directly found out that Syntastic may fail to find the bin file of Eslint (or I may need to configure that again in the future) if I didn't install eslint globally, I think it would be much better to install Eslint globally on my MBP; to install eslint globally, check [this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint#global-installation-and-usage)
- Excellent job to [this](https://medium.com/@hpux/vim-and-eslint-16fa08cc580f) post in setting up eslint with vim + __debugging__
- Remember to run __npm install -g eslint-config-airbnb-base eslint-plugin-import__ before __:SyntasticCheck eslint__ in Vim -- since I've installed eslint globally and that the debug mode ...
## OK, after linting my old porjects with eslint, I bet I'm gonna have a long way to go in modifying my bad habbits ... OMG
