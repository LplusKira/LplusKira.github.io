# DB:
## MySQL pressure test through OTLP on ubuntu 16.04 (on 1-hr test):
### Env:
On standalone MySQL OLTP test (2.5k concurrent connections): __1470 r(w)/sec, 70 transactions/sec__
### Conclusion:
This should plausibly satisfy __normal__ needs (considering the machine, 2.5k concurrent connections, and battery-included test on the own machine rather than querying from other nodes). However, the table in test is much simpler (4 columns) and queries (r/w/oth) are done in terms of transactions in a single section for each connection.
