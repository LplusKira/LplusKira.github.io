# Welcome To My .github.io

## Architecture:
- \_config.yml: config for Jekyll
- \_layouts: blog.html for blog's page and posts' pages; post.html for Jekyll rendering posts
- \_posts: where to put the posts 

## TODO:
- RSS?
- \_includes? e.g. DISQUS for commenting on blogs
- reverse search by keywords 
- [more exploration on jekyll?](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-static-sites-with-jekyll--net-22211)
