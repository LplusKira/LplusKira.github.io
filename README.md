# Welcome To My .github.io

## remind for myself what role each dir/file staring in this designated orchestra
- css/: dress up with this tuxedo, html!
- \_config.yml: config for Jekyll
- \_layouts: at least contains defualt.html which eables all pages to shine under the same layout (e.g. __layout: default__ in index.html tells Jekyll to use default.html in \_layouts/); also contains post.html speaking up for the posts
- \_posts: where to put the posts 

## TODO
- RSS?
- \_includes? e.g. DISQUS for commenting on blogs
- site map? (though it's been really simple site yet)
- linking of my favorites?
- reverse search by keywords 
- [more exploration on jekyll?](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-static-sites-with-jekyll--net-22211)
